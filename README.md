## Status
Project is: _in progress_, I spent to many time trying to decide what technologies I should use.

I use MVC architecture because it is the stable one in the market.
I try to avoid adding external libriries for this project, that makes me speend time configuring the swift way.
I can improve my code spending more time working in iOS.

I could end this project if I choose Alamofire and Realm, those libraries makes the develop easier.


## Inspiration
I'm so inpired by my teacher Norberto Ortigoza, The way he teaches iOS development is very clear.
